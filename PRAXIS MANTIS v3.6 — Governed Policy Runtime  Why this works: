PRAXIS MANTIS v3.6 - Governed Policy Runtime - Why this works.md

PRAXIS MANTIS v3.6 is a governed policy runtime designed to operate alongside PRAXIS TITAN as an explainable, fail-closed decision-support layer. It evaluates candidate mitigation policies, enforces immutable constraints (including budget authority), and emits structured, auditable outputs suitable for engineering review.

This release is intentionally not an autonomous agent. It does not self-execute actions, does not self-modify, and does not escalate privileges. It produces bounded recommendations and explicit refusals when constraints are violated.

### Key Capabilities

- **Governed Policy Evaluation**
  - Assemble candidate mitigations from a registry
  - Score and rank policies under a defined objective function
  - Emit ranked outputs with structured rationale

- **Fail-Closed Constraint Enforcement**
  - Enforces hard constraints such as **budget authority (ISC)**
  - If `policy_cost > available_budget`, MANTIS **halts/refuses** rather than improvising
  - Refusals include explicit required vs available values

- **Explainability Outputs (Audit-Grade)**
  - Produces explainability artifacts describing selection/refusal reasons
  - Explicitly references the evidence/artifacts used for evaluation
  - Designed for replay and review without hidden state

- **Offline / Artifact-Driven Execution**
  - Local-first posture aligned with PRAXIS design philosophy
  - Inputs and outputs are explicit file artifacts for traceability

### Typical Pipeline

1) Ingest artifacts and validate required fields  
2) Assemble policy candidates and attach cost/prerequisites metadata  
3) Score and rank candidates under objective function  
4) Apply governance gate (budget + hard constraints)  
5) Emit decision + explainability + verification checklist artifacts  

### Output Artifacts (Typical)

- `mantis_decision.json` — ranked candidates, selections, refusals, binding constraints  
- `mantis_explain.json` — explainability trace: reasons, evidence, checks  
- `mantis_verification.json` — operator checklist to validate expected impact  
- `mantis_log.txt` — human-readable runtime summary  

(Exact filenames may vary; the contract is structured + auditable + replayable.)

### Non-Goals (By Design)

- No autonomous execution  
- No self-modification  
- No privilege escalation  
- No “guessing” when required artifacts are missing  

### Disclaimer

PRAXIS MANTIS provides decision-support output only. It does not execute actions. Operators remain responsible for verification and for consulting primary sources and qualified professionals in high-stakes domains.

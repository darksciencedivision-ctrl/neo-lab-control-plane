PRAXIS MANTIS v3.6 — Governed Policy Runtime
Why This Works
Executive Summary

PRAXIS MANTIS v3.6 is a deterministic, governed policy-execution runtime designed to evaluate, authorize, and stage actions without performing uncontrolled execution. It operates as a policy brain, not an agent, enforcing explicit constraints at every stage of decision-making.

This system is engineered to be:

Deterministic

Auditable

Fail-closed

Human-governed

Cryptographically verifiable

MANTIS does not “decide” in the human sense. It scores, ranks, and refuses actions based on explicit policy, budget, and authorization gates.

This document explains why the design works, technically and operationally.

What MANTIS Is (and Is Not)
MANTIS Is

A policy evaluation engine

A budget-aware authorization gate

A deterministic planner

A risk-constrained decision scorer

A pre-execution filter

MANTIS Is Not

❌ An autonomous agent

❌ A self-executing AI

❌ A conversational system

❌ A black-box model

❌ A system with hidden state

Core Design Principle

No action may proceed unless it is explicitly justified, budgeted, authorized, and cryptographically staged.

Everything in MANTIS exists to enforce this principle.

System Architecture Overview

MANTIS operates inside a governed control plane and interfaces with other PRAXIS components via explicit file artifacts.

Primary Inputs

baseline_summary.json (from TITAN)

proposal_request.json

run_manifest.json

Policy configuration files

Budget ledgers (ISC)

Primary Outputs

Ranked policy decisions

Budget acceptance / refusal

Staged execution envelopes

Immutable state artifacts

No implicit memory. No hidden queues. No runtime drift.

Deterministic Runtime Model

MANTIS uses a pure function execution model:

(input artifacts) → (policy evaluation) → (scored outputs)


Given identical inputs, MANTIS will always produce identical outputs.

This property enables:

Reproducibility

Audit replay

External verification

Legal defensibility

Policy Evaluation Flow

Load Canonical Baseline

Path-verified

Hash-verified

Chain-validated

Load Proposal

Baseline alignment enforced

Structural validation

Intent declaration required

Apply Policy Set

Explicit rules

No heuristics

No inference shortcuts

Budget Enforcement

Hard limits (ISC)

No overdraft

No negotiation

Decision Emission

Accept / Refuse / Stage

Deterministic scoring

Full traceability

Budget Governance (Why It Matters)

Every policy decision consumes ISC (Intent-Scoped Cost) units.

Key properties:

Finite

Ledgered

Non-forgivable

Non-virtual

This prevents:

Infinite planning loops

Runaway optimization

Hidden execution costs

Policy inflation

If the budget is insufficient, execution halts — no exceptions.

Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement

MANTIS cannot authorize execution alone.

All execution paths require:

Human-signed authorization

Cryptographic verification

Explicit intent confirmation

This is not UX friction — it is deliberate governance.

Cryptographic Integrity

Every critical artifact is protected by:

SHA-256 hashing

RSA-3072 signatures

Chain-of-custody verification

This ensures:

Tamper detection

Provenance tracking

Forensic replay

Legal audit readiness

Fail-Closed by Design

If anything is missing, mismatched, or invalid:

Execution does not continue

State does not mutate

Errors are explicit

There is no “best effort” mode.

This is intentional.

Why This Works in Practice
1. No Hidden State

All system state lives in files you can inspect, diff, archive, and replay.

2. No Emergent Authority

MANTIS never gains power through learning or iteration.

3. No Execution Without Consent

Even perfect policy alignment does not bypass authorization.

4. No Silent Failure

Errors are loud, blocking, and logged.

5. No Ambiguity

Every decision can be traced to:

A rule

A budget

A signature

A hash

What This Demonstrates to Employers

MANTIS proves the ability to design:

Production-grade governance systems

Deterministic AI control planes

Safety-first execution models

Cryptographically sound pipelines

Auditable decision systems

This is systems engineering, not prompt engineering.

Current Status (v3.6)

✅ Fully operational

✅ Integrated with TITAN + NEO

✅ Dry-run execution gate enforced

✅ Cryptographic chain verified

✅ Reference baseline frozen

No uncontrolled execution paths exist.

Final Statement

PRAXIS MANTIS works because it refuses to be clever.

It does not guess.
It does not improvise.
It does not overreach.

It enforces structure, limits, and accountability — exactly what real-world AI systems require.

# NEO-LAB  
## Deterministic Local Cognitive Control Plane

**NEO-LAB** is a **local, deterministic cognitive control plane** for orchestrating multiple locally hosted large language models (LLMs) as **role-separated inference engines** under explicit governance, bounded memory, and fully inspectable state.

NEO-LAB is designed as a **professional engineering lab assistant**, not an autonomous agent.

All execution is local.  
All state is explicit.  
All behavior is deterministic.

---

## System Overview

NEO-LAB implements a **control-plane architecture** for AI inference rather than a traditional chatbot interface.  
It treats LLMs as **stateless, interchangeable compute engines** governed by a **stateful, deterministic controller**.

The system prioritizes:
- Predictability over emergence  
- Inspectability over opacity  
- Governance over autonomy  

This makes NEO-LAB suitable for professional, technical, and safety-conscious workflows.

---

## What NEO-LAB Is

NEO-LAB is:

- A **deterministic router** (rule-based intent → model selection)
- A **governed control plane** (explicit state, modes, and contracts)
- A **file-driven IPC system** (atomic, concurrency-safe)
- A **local-first AI system** (offline-capable, no cloud dependency)
- A **single-response generator** for summaries, detailed explanations, and multi-page reports

NEO-LAB is **not**:

- An autonomous agent
- A self-modifying system
- A tool-execution framework
- A blended or ensemble model
- A cloud service

---

## Core Architecture (Atomic File-Based IPC)

NEO-LAB uses an **atomic per-message file queue** to eliminate race conditions and ensure deterministic execution.



queue_v2/
├─ inbox/ # One JSON file per user message
├─ outbox/
│ └─ <message_id>/
│ ├─ status.json # Execution phase, progress counters
│ └─ response.txt # Streaming model output
└─ processed/ # Archived input messages


### Processing Flow



User
↓
neo_chat.ps1
↓ (atomic JSON message)
queue_v2/inbox/<id>.json
↓
neo_loop.ps1
├─ intent classification
├─ explicit state & persona loading
├─ deterministic model routing
├─ streaming inference
├─ bounded memory update
↓
queue_v2/outbox/<id>/response.txt


**Key properties:**
- No message overwrites
- Safe concurrency
- Replayable execution
- Fully inspectable artifacts

---

## Model Roles (One Active Model per Request)

NEO-LAB routes requests deterministically.  
Exactly **one model** is active per request.

Typical role mapping (configurable):

| Cognitive Role | Model |
|---------------|-------|
| Chat / Persona | dolphin-llama3 |
| Code | deepseek-coder-v2 |
| Analysis | deepseek-r1 |
| Vision | qwen2.5-vl |

Model availability is queried dynamically via Ollama.  
If a target model is unavailable, NEO-LAB fails closed or falls back safely.

---

## Output Modes (Single-Response Guarantees)

NEO-LAB is designed to produce **one complete response per request**, regardless of domain.

Supported one-shot modes:

- `/summary <topic>` — concise, complete response
- `/detail <topic>` — detailed technical explanation
- `/report <topic>` — single multi-page structured report

### Report Writer Mode

When enabled (`/reportmode on`), NEO-LAB enforces a strict output contract.

**Required sections:**
1. Executive Summary  
2. Scope & Assumptions  
3. Core Analysis  
4. Methods / Models / Math (if applicable)  
5. Implementation (if applicable)  
6. Risks, Limitations, Verification Checklist  
7. References / Source Guidance (if applicable)

No follow-up questions.  
No partial answers.  
One complete professional deliverable.

---

## Streaming Output & Progress Visibility

NEO-LAB streams output incrementally while models generate.

Progress is written to:



queue_v2/outbox/<id>/status.json


Including:
- Current execution phase
- Characters written
- Streaming activity indicators

This ensures transparency during long-running analyses and reports.

---

## Memory System (Bounded & Inspectable)

Memory is:
- JSON-based
- Explicitly bounded
- Stored on disk
- Separated by intent



queue/
├─ memory_chat.json
├─ memory_code.json
├─ memory_analysis.json
└─ memory_vision.json


There are:
- No embeddings
- No hidden vectors
- No implicit recall

Memory can be inspected or cleared at any time.

---

## Governance & Safety Posture

NEO-LAB is designed with explicit safety constraints:

- No autonomy
- No self-execution
- No self-modification
- No privilege escalation
- Human remains root authority

The system favors **control, auditability, and predictability** over emergent behavior.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11  
- PowerShell 5.1  
- Ollama (local inference server)

Recommended Ollama models:
- dolphin-llama3  
- deepseek-coder-v2  
- deepseek-r1  
- qwen2.5-vl  

---

## Quick Start

Start the control loop (Terminal A):

```powershell
cd C:\ai_control\NEO_Stack
.\neo_loop.ps1


Start the chat client (Terminal B):

cd C:\ai_control\NEO_Stack
.\neo_chat.ps1


Example:

/report Write a multi-page engineering report explaining why atomic IPC queues prevent race conditions.

QA Harness (Optional)

A simple QA harness validates report structure and completeness:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\qa\qa_harness.ps1


Results are written to:

tests/qa/qa_results.json

Roadmap

Report size governor (short / normal / long)

Live-tail streaming output in chat client

Stronger output validation and regression tests

Optional message integrity verification
